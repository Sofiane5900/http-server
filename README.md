A simple HTTP server written in C# using `HttpListener`.  
It runs in the console and listens on `http://localhost:8080/`, returning basic HTML or text responses.

## Features (in progress)

- Basic GET request handling
- HTML response rendering
- Console-based runtime
- Native .NET API (`HttpListener`)
